# marvelJS â€” the AngularJS Marvel API Browser

This project is a test bed which I use to learn and test [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) web app development.

As data from a webservice I use [Marvel(r) Developer's API](https://developer.marvel.com/) and access all the welth of comics and comic characters from their Universe (one of my passions), so while I test and learn I am also constructing a way to access all that information.

Feel free to have a look and use as you may need.
