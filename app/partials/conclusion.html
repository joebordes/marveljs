<h3>Second Round</h3>


<h3>First Round</h3>

<h4>ngGrid 2 and 3</h4>
<hr>
I couldn't get these working. version 2 worked but it took me forever to get a decent sized grid that acted responsively by width. I couldn't get it to expand correctly in height no matter how I tried. I had an image field in one column that worked ok but another big description field had all text cut at some arbitary lenght that I couldn't overcome....<br>
Version 3 directly didn't work, columns were mixed with no formatting...<br>
To complicated.<br>

<h4>Tablesaw</h4>
<hr>
VERY good impression. Basically just worked as expected. This one stays on my list for a second round.<br>


<h4>angularjs-datatables  <a href="https://datatables.net/">Datatables</a></h4>
<hr>
VERY Promising. I couldn't get it to work with REST but everything I have read and seen makes me believe that this could be the one. Right now I'd say better than Tablesaw alghough I haven't looked into responsiveness yet.  Passes to second round.<br>


<h4>Smart Table</h4>
Looks good. I couldn't get filter/search nor paging to work and I can't see inline edit, but being native AngularJS is ver good.<br>
