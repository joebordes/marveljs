<h2>AngularJS Grid Review and testing.</h2>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<div class="table-responsive">
<table class="table table-striped table-responsive">
<tr>
	<th></th>
	<th ng-repeat="evaled in evaledList"><a href="{{evaled.url}}">{{evaled.name}}</a></th>
</tr>
<tr ng-repeat="(key, val) in conclusionList">
	<td><b>{{key}}</b></td>
	<td align="center">{{val.angularjs_datatables}}</td>
	<td align=center>{{val.SmartTables}}</td>
	<td align=center>{{val.trNgGrid}}</td>
	<td align=center>{{val.adapt_strap}}</td>

	<td align=center><b>Result:</b></td>
	<td align=center ng-repeat="evaled in evaledList"><b>{{resultSum[evaled.name]}}</b></td>

From the scores above it seems that Smart Table is the winner, but trNgGrid needs a second look.

<table class="table table-striped table-responsive">
<tr>
<td><b>Datatables</b></td><td>Very mature. Has everything you will need, but it is jquery based.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>SmartTables</b></td><td>This is the one if we go AngularJS. If we bring in the responsiveness of Tablesaw and some of the features of Datatables, we should have everything we need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>trNgGrid</b></td><td>The ease and philosophy of this project is spectacular. If it were responsive it would knock out the others hands down. MUST keep an eye on this one. REALLY!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>adapt_strap</b></td><td>This one is nice, currently kind of basic but it is very young. Keep an eye on it.</td>
</tr>

<h3>Second Round</h3>

After the first round I set the scores on the different grids which led me to only evaluate two in the second round:

<hr><h4>Smart Table</h4>
I couldn't get sort nor search to work, so I didn't insist. Not being responsive out of the box will make me go for the other tool. 

<hr><h4><i class="fa fa-thumbs-up"> </i>  trNgGrid  <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up"> </i></h4>
The second round here was a breeze. Much like the first round which made a good impression I simply went through the different features carefully and they all worked except selecting rows, even paging against a 32000 record database. <span style="font-weight: bold;font-size: large;">This is the one.</span>

<h3>First Round</h3>

<hr><h4>ngGrid 2 and 3</h4>
I couldn't get these working. version 2 worked but it took me forever to get a decent sized grid that acted responsively by width. I couldn't get it to expand correctly in height no matter how I tried. I had an image field in one column that worked ok but another big description field had all text cut at some arbitary lenght that I couldn't overcome....<br>
Version 3 directly didn't work, columns were mixed with no formatting...<br>
To complicated.<br>


<hr><h4>angularjs-datatables  <a href="https://datatables.net/">Datatables</a></h4>
VERY Promising. I couldn't get it to work with REST but everything I have read and seen makes me believe that this could be the one. Right now I'd say better than Tablesaw alghough I haven't looked into responsiveness yet.  Passes to second round.<br>


<hr><h4>Smart Table</h4>
Looks good. I couldn't get filter/search nor paging to work and I can't see inline edit, but being native AngularJS is ver good.<br>

<hr><h4>trNgGrid</h4>
Interesting but seems a bit immature. Responsive didn't work directly. Couldn't see an easy way to customize a cell value (image).<br>

Spectacular the ease of getting it working with basically no configuration.

<hr><h4>adapt_strap</h4>
Looks good but lacking features. I couldn't get it working with ajax.
